Hello world!

This is Laura, and this is just a test. I'm here to learn how to create software. Starting from 0, I hope to get to a decent point before my 30s. I'm from Venezuela and my biggest dream is to travel around the world, visit every city and meet all kinds of people.

About the repository:

This is my first repository ever, so it is mostly just to test some code and see what the community has to say about it, feel free to join in on the discussion or add your own code to test!

Yes, in the end we are creating a modern Frankenstein.
