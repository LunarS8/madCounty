Hello world!

  <h3>About the repository:</h3>
  
  This is my first repository ever, so it is mostly just to test some code and see what the community has to say about it, feel free to join in on the discussion or add your own code to test!

Yes, in the end, we are creating a modern Frankenstein.

  <h3>About me:</h3>
  
  This is Laura, and this is just a test. I'm here to learn how to create software. Starting from 0, I hope to get to a decent point before my 30s.
I'm from Venezuela and love languages (both human's and computer's!) I'm currently learning French, German and Japanise. I invite you to post comments in your mother language if you wish.
